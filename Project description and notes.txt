Title
	Desing and integration of a low-cost Petri dish dispenser for a variety of dish sizes.

Problem formulation
	Many current laboratory machines that work with Petri dishes are unable to insert clean Petri dishes if these are in variating sizes. The few that actually are able to handle variating sizes are either very costly or aimed for laboratory machines used in intensive setups. This eliminates the possibility for less intesive and low-budget setups to benefit from using different sizes of Petri dishes in experiments unless several Petri dish inserters are aquired.



Method
	Iteratively create, test and improve invented designs for the low-cost mechanism to insert Petri dishes. This may be done by using technologies like 3D printing, laser cutting or similar, while adding sensors and actuators to provide correct feedback and manipulation of the designed parts.
	In order to support easy integration of the design, this project will also include a fair amount of focus on the software. This includes software taking part in the chain of layers all the way from directly controlling the hardware components to the API using in the UI.
