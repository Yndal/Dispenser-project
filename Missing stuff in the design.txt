Add excentric spacers
Horizontal 20x20 bars needs to be stabilized - right now they can be twisted around
	May use 20x40 (horizontal) bars instead: Would get the manipulator closer to the dishes
End stops and other sensors
Re-design vertical motor mount: 3D prints take too long time
Make flexibal way to attach cables










TODO
	Create BOM and send this to Andres - in this week
	Aim for the rods to be 500mm
	Add corners to keep horizontal profiles in place


Hints
	Detect horizontal layers
